  <h3>For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a digital composition inspired by an aspect of life under COVID-19 without using any traditional design software. It was a difficult challenge to overcome because we were unable to use anything programs from the adobe suite which I had become accustomed to using for design. One of the big difficulties I found was finding the right program to use to create the composition that I had in my head. After surfing the internet, I came across some relatively simple typographic designs that could be done outside of traditional design programs. Another problem I had was my composition had some conflicting views with my intention but with the critiques we had in class, I was able to sort everything out in the end. To create my composition, I ended up using google slides to create my composition.</h3>

<h4>Most of my inspiration came from images on the web or social media relating to typography or COVID.</h4>
